                    <p>Quizes are fun competitions that teach us a lot as well, however they have some flaws, the buzzers in rapid-fire rounds are expensive and hard to maintain. These apps are the solution to this problem. Both of these apps work in tandom, a team can join in and once they press the buzzer, it will be recorded on the Quiz master app.</p>
